# Resume webpage

Built with [Eleventy ](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Features:
- JSON files for easier managing of resume information
- Custom filters for information
- Localization with `-language` attribute for .njk files -> index.html tries to determine language and automatically redirects
- 404 page (localization WIP)

Based on the templates of [Vredeburg](https://github.com/daflh/vredeburg) and [resume](https://github.com/maxboeck/resume).
